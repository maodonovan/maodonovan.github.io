\label{sec:introduction} 
South Africans have come to be despondent in dealing with state bodies. Whether it is Home Affairs, the local licensing department, local government officers we expect to be confronted with disdainful and inept staff, massive delays, erratic infrastructure and abysmal service levels. There is little reason to think that the court system is any better than other other state departments. The adversarial nature of court procedures hints at dealings with the judicial system being even more fraught. It is also often assumed that individuals marginalised by poverty and  social circumstances (or simply as a result of facing prosecution) will also draw the short end of the straw when dealing with courts. The GRPU surveys affords an opportunity to test theses perceptions - at least as far as courts on the Western and Eastern Cape are concerned.  This report presents the top-line results of the GRPU survey of court users.

Although 1041 interviews were completed among 'court users' 108 of the interviews were concluded with court employees. As the employees have demographic, social and attitudinal profiles that differ from general members of the public they were (initially) excluded from the analysis. The resulting analysis is thus confined to the 933 members of the public.
